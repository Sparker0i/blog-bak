I've been showing my love, affection and madness for this franchise across all social media platforms. </p><p>I got invited by the RCB management - along with a few more mad fans like me - to cheer for RCB whenever we bought a player during the IPL auction. Â Imagine how it feels when you get recognized for showing madness for a team by them. It just happened to me, and this will go down as one of the best things that has ever happened in my life.</p><p>We were to do a livestream on Instagram, Facebook and the official RCB app on the day. The host of the day was - RCB's 12th Man - Navneeth Krishna. I even got lucky as I got to talk with him, and took a selfie as well:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6QJVxnh5ho/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF;

Then we were given some special tips on how to reply when a question was asked during the livestream.</p><p>The first hour, we bought two big players - Aaron Finch and Chris Morris, both would help in solving two critical problems RCB has had to face over the years - Solid Opener (so that Virat and ABD can be destructive in the middle order) and a Death Bowler. While all of us there felt that they were a little too pricey, but still all of us believed that these 2 players will be the key for RCB to win their first trophy in 2020.</p><p>During the first break, I also got to meet another person who is special for RCB.

<img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/1_fqwE_Sk2pCO5orZTRoivgg.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac"><p>I&#8217;ve never liked to make changes to my laptop by providing my admin credentials to install various tools, like MySQL because I love doing things at a user level. Programs like VSCode and Atom are good examples of that when all you do is drag the application icon to the Applications folder. Homebrew is also a good example to install command line applications at a user level.</p>



<p>If you were to install using the official installer, you&#8217;d have to give administrator rights. You will also have to make changes to your bash profile to access mysql in terminal. All these problems can be alleviated by installing a MySQL container inside Docker.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you&#8217;re using a Mac and want to use MySQL without making many installation changes, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.  </p></blockquote>



<h3 id="install-docker">INSTALL DOCKER COMMUNITY EDITION</h3>



<p>Download Docker Desktop for Mac by visiting this <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&amp;offering=community">link. </a>Then you need to install Docker on your Mac by following the installation steps. It is recommended not to change any defaults if prompted.</p>



<p>Once you are done with that, we will now proceed with the installation of MySQL container inside Docker. You can either do it inside a terminal, or use a tool like Kitematic using which you can manage multiple containers in your system once you create them. </p>



<p>Fire up a terminal, and write this command</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker run --name=mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_USER=developer -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mydbpwd -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb mysql/mysql-server</code></pre>



<p>Here we will use the <code>mysql/mysql-server</code> image, and our Username, password and Database are <code>developer</code>, <code>mydbpwd</code> and <code>mydb</code> respectively. Then do the port mapping between the container and the host. We bind Container&#8217;s port 3306 to the Mac&#8217;s port 3306.</p>



<p>If everything goes fine, you should see a combination of alphabets and numbers as an output. This is the container ID. Type this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker exec -it mysql bash -c "mysql -u developer -p"</code></pre>



<p>Then enter the password you entered while creating the container (In this case <code>mydbpwd</code>). Then you will have an instance up and running inside Docker.</p>



<h3>CHECK MYSQL CONNECTIVITY INSIDE MYSQL WORKBENCH</h3>



<p>First up install MySQL Workbench, either using the official installer or using the brew command <code>brew cask install mysqlworkbench</code>. Once you open up the MySQLWorkbench, click on the add connection button, then enter as following:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac" class="wp-image-678" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image.png 798w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-300x188.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"><figcaption>Creating a new connection inside MySQL Workbench<br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then click the Test Connection button. If everything goes alright, you will get this popup:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac" class="wp-image-679" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1.png 420w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"><figcaption>Connection established with MySQL Container in Docker</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>



<p>Installing MySQL in Docker on your PC is a safer approach to installing MySQL than providing Admin credentials to install using the official installer. If anything goes wrong, all you have to do is delete the container and create a new one in Docker.</p>

<h3>Chennai Super Kings</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-fnroqrhvavqlun56bo2l4j2131-20181114210303.Medi.jpeg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Chennai Super Kings</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain: MS Dhoni.<br>Batsmen: Suresh Raina, M Vijay, Kedar Jadhav, Sam Billings, Ambati Rayudu, N Jagadeesan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Dhruv Shorey, Faf du Plessis.<br>All rounders:&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo, Shane Watson,&nbsp;Ravindra Jadeja,&nbsp;Mitchell Santner,&nbsp;Chaitanya Bishnoi.<br>Pace bowlers: Mohit Sharma,&nbsp;Deepak Chahar, KM Asif, David Willey, Lungi Ngidi, ,&nbsp;Shardul Thakur,&nbsp;Monu Kumar.<br>Spinners:&nbsp;Karn Sharma,&nbsp;Imran Tahir,&nbsp;Harbhajan Singh.</p>



<p>A batting heavy CSK didn&#8217;t have much work to do other than getting a fast bowler as they had a thin backup options. They have filled this spot by buying Mohit Sharma, a former player of the franchise. He was one of the Indian bowlers available in the auction.</p>



<p>There was another pick in Ruturaj Gaikwad. He&#8217;s an opening player for Maharashtra. Though he is unlikely to feature in the playing XI, but he is a good backup option for this side.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Watson, du Plessis, Raina, Rayudu, Dhoni, Jadhav, Santner, Bravo, Harbhajan/Karn, Thakur, Mohit Sharma</p>



<h3>Delhi Capitals</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://st3.cricketcountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/delhi-daredevils-bowler-shahbaz-nadeem.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Delhi Capitals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain: Shreyas Iyer.<br>Batsmen: Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Manjot Kalra, Colin Munro,Â Hanuma Vihari,Â Colin Ingram,Â Sherfane Rutherford.<br>Keeper: Rishabh Pant, Ankush Bains.<br>All rounders: Harshal Patel, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Axar Patel, Jalaj Saxena.<br>Pace bowlers: Ishant Sharma, Nathu Singh, Keemo Paul, Bandaru Ayyappa, Avesh Khan,Â Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult.<br>Spin bowlers:Â Amit Mishra,Â Sandeep Lamichhane.</p>



<p>DC, my favourite team before it disbanded in 2012 has now got a new expansion.&nbsp;<del>Daredevils</del> Capitals, as the Delhi franchise is now known as, has been consistently finishing at the bottom half of the table. They had the second biggest purse coming into the auction and had to fill the middle order and all-rounder spots. DC also needed good backup players.</p>



<p>Their first buy &#8211; Hanuma Vihari, though unlikely to feature in the XI, is a solid backup option to the top 4. Their next buy &#8211; Axar Patel, at 5 cr, is nothing but bargain as&nbsp;he fills one of the all-rounder spots left vacant after Delhi traded 3 players to SRH. They also purchased the explosive Colin Ingram, a utility batsman.</p>



<p>They also had a problem with their pace department which they&nbsp;have addressed this by bringing in Ishant Sharma for a meagre 1.1 cr. Other buys include Ankush Bains, Nathu Singh, Sherfane Rutherford, Keemo Paul, Jalaj Saxena and Bandaru Ayyappa.</p>



<p>Overall this side looks well settled with their top 4 &#8211; Dhawan, Shaw, Iyer, Pant,&nbsp;complemented by Rabada, Morris, Axar and Boult.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Dhawan, Shaw, Iyer, Ingram, Pant, Morris, Patel, Boult, Rabada, Mishra, Tewatia</p>



<h3 id="mce_2"><strong>Kolkata Knight Riders</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.hindi.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/459x306/jpg/2018/11/QBVmw2b3.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Kolkata Knight Riders<br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain:&nbsp;Dinesh Karthik.<br>Batsmen: Robin Uthappa, Chris Lynn, Shubman Gill, Joe Denly, Nitish Rana, Nikhil Naik, Rinku Singh. <br>All rounders: Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Shivam Mavi, Carlos Brathwaite.<br>Pace bowlers: Anrich Nortje, Lockie Ferguson, Harry Gurney, Yarra Prithviraj, Shrikant Mundhe, Prasidh Krishna,&nbsp;Kamlesh Nagarkoti<br>Spin bowlers:&nbsp;Piyush Chawla, Kuldeep Yadav<br></p>



<p>KKR was expected to be battling out for players, as they had to fill a lot of spots, and not end up with a squad as thin as the one they had last season. WI allrounder Carlos Brathwaite was their first and the biggest purchase of the day at 5 cr. Known for his big hitting abilities, he was underutilized at SRH last season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other utility buys include Lockie Ferguson and Joe Denly for 1.6 and 1 cr respectively. These three players should provide the much needed balance in the middle order as well as good backup options. KKR will also hope that the team clicks perfectly, just like they did in the last season.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Lynn, Narine, Uthappa, Gill, Karthik, Russell, Brathwaite, Piyush, Kuldeep, Prasidh Krishna, Mavi/Nagarkoti</p>



<h3>Kings XI Punjab</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://static-news.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2018/04/Kings-XI-Punjab-KXIP-IPL-2018-770x433.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Kings XI Punjab</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain:&nbsp;Ravichandran Ashwin.<br>Keepers: Lokesh Rahul, Nicholas Pooran,&nbsp;Prabhsimran Singh.<br>Batsmen: Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, Sarfaraz Khan, Karun Nair, David Miller.<br>All rounders: Andrew Tye,&nbsp;Sam Curran. <br>Pace bowlers: Mohammed Shami, Agnivesh Ayachi,&nbsp;Arshdeep Singh,&nbsp;Darshan Nalkande,&nbsp;Hardus Viljoen,&nbsp;Ankit Rajpoot.<br>Spin bowlers: Mujeeb Ur Rahman,&nbsp;Harpreet Brar, Varun Chakravarthy, Murugan Ashwin.</p>



<p>This is yet another team who had a busy time at the auction, after releasing most of their players in the auction pool. They had only 9 players when they went into the auction.</p>



<p>Their biggest purchase was Varun Chakravarthy, the mystery spinner from Tamil Nadu, at 8.4 cr. They also fought with other franchises to secure the services of Mohammed Shami and Sam Curran for 4.8 and 7.2 cr respectively, solving their bowling woes. They also solved their wicket-keeper headache by buying two keepers &#8211; Nicholas Pooran for 4.2 cr and the uncapped&nbsp;Prabhsimran Singh for 4.8 cr.</p>



<p>Other purchases include Sarfaraz Khan,&nbsp;Agnivesh Ayachi,&nbsp;Arshdeep Singh,&nbsp;Darshan Nalkande,&nbsp;Murugan Ashwin,&nbsp;Hardus Viljoen,&nbsp;Harpreet Brar.</p>



<p>They now look like a mini-RCB side, after buying players released by RCB in the last 2 seasons (Rahul, Gayle, Mandeep, Sarfaraz, M Ashwin). Nevertheless, they look well sorted now.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Rahul, Gayle, Agarwal, Nair, Miller, Sarfaraz/Mandeep, Curran, Tye, Chakravarthy, Ashwin, Shami</p>



<h3>Mumbai Indians</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://statics.sportskeeda.com/editor/2018/01/baa93-1515418098-800.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Mumbai Indians</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain:&nbsp;Rohit Sharma.<br>Batsmen: Suryakumar Yadav, Siddhesh Lad, Evin Lewis, Yuvraj Singh.<br>Keepers: Ishan Kishan, Quinton de Kock, Aditya Tare.<br>All rounders: Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Anukul Roy, Kieron Pollard, Ben Cutting,&nbsp;Pankaj Jaiswal.<br>Pace bowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne, Jason Behrendorff, Lasith Malinga, , Barinder Sran, Rasikh Dar.<br>Spin bowlers: Mayank Markande, Rahul Chahar,&nbsp;Anmolpreet Singh.</p>



<p>MI headed into the auction to fill their squad with reliable backup options. They bought 6 players. The biggest buy was Barinder Sran at 3.6 cr. He could be the replacement for Bumrah, if he is rested anytime during the season due to workload management.</p>



<p>Former MI Player and last season&#8217;s mentor, Lasith Malinga returns as a player for the next season. By buying Yuvraj Singh, MI becomes my second favourite team (no brownie points on guessing which my favourite team is), despite going unsold in the first round of auction. They also bought uncapped players Anmolpreet Singh, Pankaj Jaiswal and Rasikh Dar. They&#8217;ve also traded Jayant Yadav from DC right after the auctions.</p>



<p>Likely XI: de Kock, Lewis, Yadav, Rohit, Krunal, Kishan, Hardik, Bumrah, Cutting, Malinga/Pollard, Yuvraj/Anukul/Markande/Yadav</p>



<h3>Rajasthan Royals</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/04/17/Pictures/cricket-t20-ind-ipl-rajasthan-delhi_07305322-4231-11e8-9c90-d40a08109dff.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Rajasthan Royals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain: Steve Smith.<br>Batsmen: Ajinkya Rahane,&nbsp; Aryaman Birla, Rahul Tripathi, Liam Livinstone, Shashank Singh, Manan Vohra, Riyan Parag.<br>Keepers: Sanju Samson, Prashant Chopra, Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer.<br>All rounders: Stuart Binny, Ben Stokes,&nbsp;S. Midhun, Mahipal Lomror, Shubham Rajane. <br>Pace bowlers: Jaydev Unadkat, Dhawal Kulkarni, Varun Aaron, Oshane Thomas.<br>Spin bowlers: Ashton Turner, Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal,&nbsp;Ish Sodhi</p>



<p>Having retained the core of the last season, Rajasthan were definitely bolstered by the return of their captain, Steve Smith. Despite that, they were in need of good Indian bowlers. They played a smart move by releasing Jaydev Unadkat to the auction pool and buying him at a lower price than last season and&nbsp;followed this by buying another pacer in Varun Aaron.</p>



<p>They also filled their overseas spots by buying Oshane Thomas, Liam Livingstone and BBL sensation Ashton Turner and&nbsp;also bought Manan Vohra to strengthen their middle order prospects.</p>



<p>RR now need to focus on what their batting order will look like, as it will get confusing especially after the return of Smith.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Rahane, Tripathi, Smith, Samson, Buttler, Stokes, Gowtham, Archer/Thomas, Kulkarni, Unadkat, Gopal.</p>



<h3>Royal Challengers Bangalore</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.crictracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Royal-Challengers-Bangalore-6.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Royal Challengers Bangalore</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Captain:&nbsp;Virat Kohli<br>Batsmen: AB de Villiers, Shimron Hetmyer,&nbsp;Himmat Singh, Milind Kumar, Devdutt Padikkal.<br>Keepers: Parthiv Patel, Akshdeep Nath, Heinrich Klaasen. <br>All Rounders:&nbsp; Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Moeen Ali, Colin de Grandhomme, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Shivam Dube.<br>Pace bowlers: Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kulwant Khejroliya, Nathan Coulter-Nile,&nbsp;Mohammed Siraj.<br>Spin bowlers: Prayas Barman,&nbsp;Yuzvendra Chahal.</p>



<p>Here comes my favourite team. RCB had a pretty balanced team last season only to be let down by their batting. They had their bowlers and all-rounders sorted before going into the auction.&nbsp;All they needed to have quite a lot of batsmen to provide cover to Virat and de Villiers.</p>



<p>One big purchase they made was that of Shimron Hetmyer for 4.2 cr. He had impressed by showcasing his talent in the Ind-WI matches last month. Another bug purchase was that of the uncapped all-rounder Shivam Dubey for 5 cr. Both of them were expected to go for big amounts in the auction. They also made utility buys in the explosive Protea keeper Heinrich Klassen and batsman-keeper-all-rounder package Akshdeep Nath. They bought a few domestic players &#8211; Milind Kumar, Himmat Singh and Prayas Barman.</p>



<p>RCB improved their&nbsp;squad massively by addressing the concerned areas. Their playing XI will depend a lot on who their 4 overseas players will be.</p>



<p>Likely XI: Kohli, Patel, de Villiers, Hetmyer, Stoinis/Ali, Dubey, Sundar, Southee/Coulter Nile, Yadav, Siraj, Chahal</p>



<h3>Sunrisers Hyderabad</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://statics.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sunrisers-hyderabad-1491131967-800.jpg" alt="IPL Auction Strategies: Analysis and Likely XI Prediction"><figcaption>Sunrisers Hyderabad</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Players:&nbsp;David Warner, Yusuf Pathan, Rashid Khan, Shakib Al Hasan, Billy Stanlake, Kane Williamson, Mohammad Nabi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Manish Pandey, T Natarajan, Ricky Bhui, Sandeep Sharma, Shreevats Goswami, Siddarth Kaul, Khaleel Ahmed, Basil Thampi, Deepak Hooda, Jonny Bairstow, Wriddhiman Saha, Martin Guptill, Vijay Shankar, Shahbaz Nadeem, Abhishek Sharma</p>



<p>Last year&#8217;s runner-up had a settled squad much before the auction despite losing Shikhar Dhawan to DC. They have some of the best batsmen as well as having the most feared bowling attack in the tournament.</p>



<p>The only major requirement was a keeper. They addressed this by buying two keepers &#8211; Jonny Bairstow for 2.2 cr and Wriddhiman Saha for 1.2 cr, after releasing him back to the pool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likely XI: Warner, Williamson, Pandey, Shakib, Pathan, Abhishek Sharma, Bhuvaneshwar, Kaul, Nadeem, Sandeep Sharma, Rashid Khan</p>

<p>When you unbox the cover, you will notice a few things available in the package. You will up to a Plastic TPU case bundled, at least in the Indian market. Another thing you will notice is the in-ear earphones, not quite common today. Also, you will notice 2 pairs of earbuds for the earphones, another good thing to have.</p>



<p>We also have the USB type C charging cable bundled. Moreover, you get a Fast charger with this phone, something you expect at this price point. Then we have a 2 pin charger having variable rating reading 5V-2.5A/9V-2A/12V-1.5A. The good news is this is a Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 supported fast charger, meaning it will take lesser time to charge the phone than your usual 5V/2A charger. Apart from this, you will also see a SIM Ejector tool, a user warranty manual, and some support documents</p>

<h3>BODY</h3>



<p>A single Series 6000 Aluminium Block makes up the body of the phone. You will also feel the weight of the Aluminium build in your hands. That being said, this phone is not like the other metal phones that you see in the market. This phone has 6 layers of ceramic coating on the back (this is what HMD Global says ??ââ), which is why you don&#8217;t see any antenna lines on the back of the phone like other metal phones.</p>



<p>The phone comes in 2 color variants &#8211; Black/Copper and White/Copper. My phone is the Black/Copper variant, with a matte black back and a copper accent running around the frame, as well as on the sides of the camera, the fingerprint sensor and the Nokia logo written&nbsp;on the back of the phone.</p>



<h4>BACK SIDE</h4>



<p>The phone comes with a dual camera setup with Zeiss lenses, highlighting the company&#8217;s partnership with HMD Global for the phone. Then there&#8217;s a dual-tone LED flash on the right of the camera bump. Below the camera, we have a fingerprint sensor, a common feature in all phones now. Also, there exists a secondary noise-cancellation microphone above the camera bump.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-513" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back.jpg 770w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-154x300.jpg 154w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-768x1496.jpg 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-526x1024.jpg 526w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px"><figcaption>Nokia 7 Plus back side</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the USP of this phone is the Android One branding written on the lower side of the back. Then there&#8217;s some more text below it &#8211; Model Number (TA-1046), Made In India branding, and HMD Global&#8217;s address. (Don&#8217;t go by Made In China in the image)</p>



<h4>FRONT SIDE</h4>



<p>Coming to the front, we have a 6-inch 2.5D IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2160&#215;1080 in an 18:9 aspect ratio. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean that this is a full-screen phone with&nbsp;bezels on the top and the bottom, and minimal side bezels. Since it is a 2.5D display, it curves towards the edges of the phone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-514" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front.jpg 869w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-174x300.jpg 174w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-768x1326.jpg 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-593x1024.jpg 593w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"><figcaption>Front Side of Nokia 7 Plus</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the top, we have the proximity sensor, hidden due to the black background. We also have the earpiece, which doesn&#8217;t double up as a speaker. At last, we have the 16MP front camera, followed by the iconic Nokia logo in the top right corner.</p>



<h4>EDGES</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-516" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge.jpg 1200w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Left Edge of Nokia 7 Plus. Courtesy: <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_plus-review-1752.php">GSMArena</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the left edge of the phone, you will see the SIM card slot. In the Indian variant, this holder can have either 2 nano SIMs or 1 nano SIM and 1 MicroSD Card, with a capacity of up to 256 GB. While other phones around this price point are giving 512 GB of expandable memory, it is sad to see this phone providing only half the storage. Despite this, 64 GB internal storage will not fill up fast.</p>



<p>On the right edge of the phone, you will see the volume buttons and the power button arranged in that particular order. There&#8217;s a style quotient in the phone because of the copper accent throughout the frame. With the style box checked, the buttons are good. It gives that crisp, tacky sound when clicked. Despite this, it is not too difficult to press those buttons either, you would just press them like on any other phone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-515" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right.jpg 1200w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Top and right edges of Nokia 7 plus. Courtesy: <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_plus-review-1752.php">GSMArena</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the top edge, you will only find a headphone jack (luckily, at this price point). I will surely miss the IR blaster from the Redmi Note 3 (my previous phone). On the bottom edge, you will find the microphone, charger input slot as well as the speakers.</p>



<h4>DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT</h4>



<p>The phone&#8217;s physical dimensions are 158.4 x 75.6 x 8.0mm. This phone weighs at 183g, 19g more than my previous phone, Redmi Note 3. Despite that, the increase in weight doesn&#8217;t seem to be much, indicating that the weight has been distributed properly throughout the phone. The weight is definitely better distributed than the Lenovo P1m which weighs 143g. With my experience, the Lenovo P1m felt heavier than this.</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<h3>DISPLAY</h3>



<p>Given that the display comes in an 18:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners, it seems to follow the modern display trends.&nbsp;There&#8217;s no OLED display in this phone, but looking at the vibrant colors the display produces, one may mistake this for an OLED screen. In fact, at one look, anyone might mistake this for a Google Pixel 2 XL. The scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3 shields the phone&#8217;s display.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know much of technical stuff regarding displays, but I can compare this phone to my old Redmi Note 3. The color reproduction&nbsp;is better than Note 3. Maximum Brightness is slightly less than found on the Note 3. At maximum brightness, the black color seems to be of&nbsp;great quality, though not as great as an OLED, which is why one would mistake the screen for an AMOLED one. Screen legibility under sunlight is far better.</p>



<p>While there are multiple websites reporting that the screen whites tilt towards the blue region, suggesting for cooler colors, my phone does quite the opposite. From the Redmi Note 3 that I have had, the phone seems tinted towards warmer colors.</p>



<h3>BATTERY</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 Plus carries a 3800 mAh battery, while most flagship phones carry around 3200-3500 mAh battery.</p>



<p>Scenario 1 was a typical day of usage which involved 3.5 hours of gaming, 1.5 hours of web browsing, and the remaining time split across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Calls, and Music</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="525" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=525" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-150x300.png 150w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-768x1536.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Scenario 1</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="526" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=526" class="wp-image-526" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-150x300.png 150w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-768x1536.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Scenario 2</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Scenario 2 was of an extended gaming day, which involved 2.5 hours of PUBG, another 1.5 hours of Real Cricket 18 and 30 min of Clash of Clans, and the remaining time split across Chrome,&nbsp;WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. In both the scenarios, my phone was either connected to 4G LTE or to my WiFi router. Internet was always on my phone.</p>



<h3>SCREEN-ON-TIME AND CHARGING</h3>



<p>With such extensive usage in my case, I could get around 5-6 hours of screen-on-time and 12-14 hours of standby. For normal-to-medium usage, the phone should be easily giving you 1.5-2 days of standby, as well as 7-8 hours of screen-on-time.</p>



<p>One good thing&nbsp;in this phone is that it comes with a fast charger out of the box. 30 min of charging should take the phone to ~40% while we could achieve full charge at around 1 hour and 45 minutes. The phone says Charging Rapidly when charging from 0 to 80-82%, then regular charging to 100%. Also, the phone squeezes out the last inch of the battery until it goes down to 0%. This is unlike my Redmi Note 3, which recently started going from 10 to 0 percent charge in only a few minutes, even with the battery saver turned on.</p>



<h3>SPEAKER</h3>



<p>While the speaker loudness is quite good, there are some budget to mid-range phones that provide a louder sound from the speaker unit. Mi A1 is one of them. Another phone with louder sound than this phone is the Moto G5S plus.</p>



<h3>AUDIO CLARITY</h3>



<p>Coming to the audio clarity, the speaker audio may not be clear enough everytime. In a quiet to low-noise surroundings, the speakers are good to use. Once there&#8217;s some noise, like in a room full of people or while you are in train, the audio clarity would be okay, but the loudness just diminishes.</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<h3>ANDROID ONE</h3>



<p>Unarguably the USP of this phone, the Android One branding. It&#8217;s something that every developer craves for. It wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to stereotype this phone to a Nexus phone, given the software quality. Android One is a boon for anyone that wants something close to stock Android, but doesn&#8217;t have the budget to buy the Pixel phone series.</p>



<p>Monthly updates are also another plus point with this phone, they are timely. My phone came with Android 8.1 Oreo with the April Security patch out of the box, but the phone downloaded 4 monthly security patches since then in a sequential order and it&nbsp;is currently running on the August Security Patch. There&#8217;s also an Android Pie final developer preview build, with a stable release set for early September. Given the upgrade policy that we have seen with the last year&#8217;s Nokia smartphones, Nokia phones will receive Android upgrades way faster than any other non-Google vendor (Okay, Essential Phone beat Nokia for the Android P update, but let&#8217;s see with the others)</p>



<h4>USER INTERFACE</h4>



<p>After finishing setting up your phone, you would be looking at your launcher. This looks similar to the launcher found on the Pixel phones. It has a dock which can house a maximum of 5 app icons, or in general 5 folders. Then there&#8217;s an app drawer which is opened by pressing the up arrow above the dock or swiping up anywhere on the homescreen.</p>



<p>Have a look at the preinstalled apps. There&#8217;s no bloatware in this phone, unlike the Redmi Note 3, which not only came with the unnecessary Xiaomi apps which bombard notifications (that too uninstallable) but also with apps from other developers (eg. Facebook, Twitter, Swiftkey keyboard etc.).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="527" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=527" class="wp-image-527" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226-150x300.png 150w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226-768x1536.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-170226-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Preinstalled apps</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="528" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=528" class="wp-image-528" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830-150x300.png 150w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830-768x1536.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-172830-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Lock Screen</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Once you lock your phone, the lock screen would be visible. Again, it is the standard stock Android lock screen, the time and date at the centre, with the camera shortcut on the bottom-right and the voice-assist shortcut at the bottom left corner. Then there&#8217;s the fingerprint icon between these two, if you have enabled it, otherwise, it would be a standard lock screen.</p>



<p>Unlocking the phone when the screen is off doesn&#8217;t take much time. The screen unlocks instantly with the fingerprint scanner, like many flagship phones.</p>



<p>Now given that the screen size is quite huge, there might be troubles to reach the top of the screen, depending upon the position in which you are holding the phone). This is why the Nokia 7 plus provides an option of gestures. Particularly, swipe down to reveal notifications is the most helpful. Then there&#8217;s also a double-press power button to launch the camera gesture, along with other useful gestures.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=529"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-529" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-150x300.png 150w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-768x1536.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Also there are the&nbsp;useful Google apps, like Google Photos for the gallery, Google Chrome for browsing. I wish there were two more apps pre-installed, a Calculator app and a Voice Recorder app, which would have completed the essentials suite.</p>



<h3>SYNTHETICS</h3>



<p>Nokia 7 Plus is powered by the Snapdragon 660 processor. It has 8 Kryo cores, 4 of the 2.2 GHz and the other 4 at 1.8 GHz. There&#8217;s also Adreno 512 GPU used for powering intensive graphics tasks like gaming. Only one variant of this phone exists in India, with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. From this 64 GB, we will get 50 GB of usable space.</p>



<p>The phone feels smooth enough for daily usage. I didn&#8217;t see any visible lag in apps, until the July Security Update. With the July Security Update, apps like Chrome, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp would hang occasionally for 2-5 seconds and then resume again. Same goes when typing on the keyboard, where the keys would appear frozen until 2-5 seconds later. This is still not fixed in the August security update, but with my time on the Android P final developer preview, this problem didn&#8217;t exist. So maybe in September, with the Android P release, this would go away.</p>



<h3>GAMING AND BROWSING</h3>



<p>Gaming performance is very good &#8211; if not great. I could play PUBG at Medium to High graphics with HD Resolution (HDR and Ultra HD aren&#8217;t supported on this phone). The colors were set to realistic. I also regularly played Clash of Clans, Real Cricket 18, Knife Hit, Asphalt 9 as well. I did not notice any visible frame drop in these games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from all these, I could open up to 17 Chrome tabs upon, without any of them reloading due to dormancy. All in all, the Snapdragon 660 paired with 4 GB of RAM should be okay for everyone for day-to-day usage.</p>

<h3>REAR CAMERA</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 plus has a dual camera setup on the back. The primary one is a 12 MP dual pixel sensor (1.4 micron pixel size) with a f/1.75 aperture. The secondary camera is a 13 MP telephoto lens (1.0 micron pixel size) with up to 2x optical zoom, at an aperture of f/2.6. Both the lenses have the Carl Zeiss branding, something we&#8217;ve seen in the high-end Lumias, and the pre-Lumia Nokia smartphones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-530" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721.png 2160w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-768x384.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-1024x512.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px"><figcaption>Different modes in the camera app</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are quite a lot of modes in the camera of this phone. Photo, Video, Pro mode, Slow Motion, Live Bokeh, Panorama, Time Lapse</p>



<p>The camera app UI was good, until an update in late-August. It has different modes of the camera which have to be scrolled one-by-one by swiping left or right. We cannot scroll through all the modes at one go. This makes it difficult to find a camera mode that is situated at either end, as earlier all the modes could be accessed from the app drawer.</p>



<h4>CAMERA OPTIONS</h4>



<p>There are quite a lot of options in the camera of the Nokia 7 Plus. One of them is the Multi-Camera Mode, where you can select single, dual or PIP mode for combined shots from the front and the rear cameras. Then there&#8217;s the beauty mode, which smoothens your skin in the photos that appear. Then there&#8217;s the Flash toggle and the timer option.</p>

<p>With the new camera update, there are 2 more options &#8211; Motion Photos and Google Lens, powered by Google. Motion Photos records a 2s video of what happens right before the image is taken. Then there&#8217;s the Google Lens button which takes you to Google Lens app. In the video mode, you will now get an option to go live on Facebook or Youtube. Though I haven&#8217;t tested Youtube live, Facebook live just didn&#8217;t work for me. Hopefully HMD Global can fix this with an update.</p>

<p>Clicking on the hamburger button redirects you to Camera Settings (quite odd, as in the previous version it used to open up an app drawer with all the different modes, along with Settings). Here you will see certain options pertinent to the camera. There&#8217;s also a watermark toggle here, which lets you put up a watermark on your photo/video. You can choose between three different types of watermarks, with the Nokia | Zeiss branding being the default one.</p>



<h3>QUALITY</h3>



<p>The image quality in daylight with the rear camera is quite good. Details are mostly preserved. Noise is not an issue either. Saturation is on par with other mid-range phones. Here are some of the sample shots taken using the primary back camera.</p>

<p>Talking about the telephoto lens, it is quite a good secondary camera sensor. There won&#8217;t be visible problems with the image, unless we zoom to near the max possible limit.</p>



<p>I believe the low light camera performance could have been better. There is quite a lot of noise when photos were taken with the low light sensor.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The phone has a mode called Live Bokeh. Basically, it&#8217;s just another name for portrait mode that you see in other phones. In this mode, the subject is kept in focus and the background is blurred while taking the photo, and not after taking it (though there exists a way to edit the blur amount after taking the photo). It works well on non-human subjects too.</p>



<p>Selfies taken with the phone are excellent, but in outdoors there may be high saturation, not always.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VIDEO QUALITY</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 Plus can record 4K videos. Sadness is when you realise that this phone can record only 30 fps video at any resolution video. There&#8217;s EIS too, but it works only with 1080p video.</p>



<p>Videos are crystal clear and sharp. They are noise-free during the daylight.&nbsp;</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<p>This phone is quite like the Nexus series of phones, providing stock Android experience without spending too much money.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>NOKIA 7 PLUS ALTERNATIVES</h3>



<p>With this being said, there are a few alternatives in the market. One of them is the Honor View 10. It has almost similar spec sheet barring the flagship processor and the 20 MP monochrome camera. Then there&#8217;s the upcoming Galaxy A8 Star, but it will cost you Rs. 35000, and it comes with Samsung&#8217;s own UI skin on top. Also, nobody knows how the camera will perform on it.</p>



<h3>Mi A2 &#8211; THE REAL CHALLENGER</h3>



<p>If there is one real challenger to the phone, it should be the Mi A2. It comes with almost the same spec sheet as this phone. The reason why I say this is a real challenger is that of its price. The Mi A2 is Rs. 9000 cheaper than the Nokia 7 Plus. Mi A2&#8217;s base variant retails for Rs. 16999 whereas the Nokia 7 Plus retails for Rs. 25999. Yes, the price gap is huge.</p>



<p>Despite this, the Mi A2 may not be suited for all even at that price range. It misses out on a few key features, people buying a phone at that price point expect. There&#8217;s no headphone jack, no MicroSD slot, there&#8217;s an average battery size, and if a few reports are to be believed, the display colors also seem washed out. Now the last 3 features may not be a deal breaker at all, but the headphone jack might just be the thorn. The bundled USB-C to 3.5mm jack converter should please the Mi A2 buyers.</p>



<h3>VERDICT</h3>



<p>My final verdict would be to go for this phone only after the price drops to around Rs. 23000 as the 9000 Rupee price difference between Mi A2 and Nokia 7 Plus is just not reasonable.</p>

This visit was back in December 2017, so I&#8217;m sorry for such a long delay because I got busy with academics and other important tasks.<br></p>



<h3>CUTTING THE WOOD IN FACTORY</h3>



<p>The process starts with cutting the wood logs in the factory. This factory uses the logs of the Neem tree to obtain the final product because they are of the best quality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832.jpg"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-462" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></figure>



<p>These wood logs are first passed into a machine, from where you will get wood sheets as output. Here is a video that illustrates this better. The image below the video will show you the output of that machine.</p>

<p>The next step is to send these wood sheets to cutting, which gives us the wood sheets of required dimensions. Therefore we obtain a combination of good wood and bad wood sheets. The bad wood is sent to a burning plant in Tamilnadu to generate electricity.</p>

<p>The good wood goes on to become plywood. Here&#8217;s the good wood.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601.jpg"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-467" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a><figcaption>Good wood obtained after cutting</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similarly, there&#8217;s also another process of cutting the bad wood into a sheet of  dimensions. The video below helps describe this better</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/VID_20171212_120231.mp4"></video></figure>



<h3><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120348.jpg"></a>DRYING</h3>



<p>Once we get the sheets of good wood, these sheets dry under the sun. Usually, this finishes in around 4-5 hours, but it may vary. Here is a picture illustrating drying of good sheets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432.jpg"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-469" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>Good sheets kept for drying</figcaption></figure>



<p>Only 1 lakh sq. Km of sheets can dry at a time due to space restrictions. With a drying machine, drying wood sheets of 1 lakh + 4 lakh km sq = 5 lakh sq. km is not an issue.</p>



<p>These sheets sell in huge numbers to plywood factories, from where we obtain plywood. Each sheet will have crests and troughs. The reason is that the sheets dry under the sun. With a drying machine, this would never happen, because we get a straight sheet of wood.</p>



<h3>PLYWOOD</h3>



<p>This is a plywood made from the sheets supplied by this factory.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can see stripes between the plywood on its lateral side. Many dried wood sheets are glued together to create this, apart from the other factory processes.</p>

<h3>A PLYWOOD MACHINE PERHAPS?</h3>



<p>Ever since this factory trip took place, a drying machine was installed here. Also, there are plans on having the plywood machine as well.</p>



<p>Moreover, adding a plywood making machine alongside will give four-fold benefits:</p>



<ul><li>Good quality of dried sheets</li><li>Good quality of plywood</li><li>Increased employment, due to <g class="gr_ gr_122 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="122" data-gr-id="122">increasing</g>Â machinery and scalability requirements</li><li>Increased production, giving profit to owners</li></ul>



<h3>SIGNING-OFF</h3>



<p>Most importantly, I can&#8217;t sign off before thanking those people, because of whom I could have a hands-on tour of the factory. Here&#8217;s a pic of the factory owners (Pro tip: The one on the right is <a href="https://twitter.com/theamritanair">@theamritanair</a>&#8216;s uncle)</p>

With previous versions of Windows, Microsoft used to release a new version of Windows once every 3 years. This changed with Windows 10, when Microsoft started releasing a new version of Windows 10 every 6 months. With this, Microsoft has rolled 5 updates to this OS, the latest being the April 2018 update.</p>
<p>Compare this to the version that rolled out initially, there would be a lot of usability improvements, more strikingly on the graphic changes. Microsoft started rolling out parts of their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/">Fluent Design System</a> since 2017, changing the way every element of Windows looks. The Windows 10 you see today is the equivalent of one of those 3-year releases, and perhaps even better because Windows users have been able to provide real-time feedback, via Feedback Hub and their forums, as new features have evolved in these three years.</p>
<h3>WINDOWS 10 USER INTERFACE</h3>
<h5>Simplification</h5>
<p>When Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 initially, there were two apps with which you could control settings inside the OS &#8211; the more trusted Control Panel, and the newly built Settings app. At launch, Microsoft did state that they were looking to migrate many of the settings from the Control Panel to the new Settings app. So has happened.</p>
<p>The slider below shows how the control panel looks in Windows 7, the initial Windows 10, and the latest April 2018 update.</p>

<p>A lot of the options have been moved away from the control panel today. They now rest somewhere in the Settings app. The slider below shows how the Settings app looks in the latest update, compared to the one that initially rolled out. Several new options have been added, UI and the user experience has been improved. More importantly, many features that were previously available only in Control Panel, are now exclusive in Settings, thereby starting the process of deprecating the Control Panel.</p>

<h5>User Design</h5>
<p>Windows 10 apps had only a Light background to start with, which was not White, rather a Dull Grey. This changed in 2016, when Microsoft added a Dark Mode for Windows apps. Now the colors are either Pure white or Dark black, a welcome move.</p>
<p>The start menu has also undergone changes. In the initial release, there was a most used apps section and an all apps button below it, and the pinned tiles on the right. Microsoft merged Most apps and all apps in 2016, so that the left side now shows them together. It also added a hamburger menu, where our user account and power menu reside. On a full screen start, it also shows an option to switch between Pinned tiles and all apps. And the more glaring bugs like the one that allowed start to only <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/windows_10_bug_alert_start_menu_breaks_512_entries/">show 512 apps in all apps</a> has also been fixed.</p>

</p>
<p>Overall Score: 8/10. I will give the UX an 8 because I feel that the Fluent Design elements are not yet fully implemented throughout the OS. They are scattered throughout. If anything in those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/taking-a-closer-look-at-microsofts-fluent-design-system/">concept pictures </a>turn out to be true, I will think of this score again.</p>
<h3>UPGRADES AND UPDATES</h3>
<p>One advantage Windows 10 came with is that we don&#8217;t have to download a lot of security updates and maintanence packs, like it used to be in Windows 7 and 8.x, just one cumulative file is enough to rule them all.</p>
<p>Along with this came another certain disadvantage, 2 OS upgrades every year, unlike Android and iOS which come with 1 OS upgrade and a maintanence upgrade soon after. This can be a let-down for those who are on a tight internet budget.</p>
<p>But there is some relief for those who worry about the data. Firstly, some clever engineering has allowed Microsoft to shrink the update size slightly, by around 35%, which means that an upgrade that would previously download 4.4 GB would now download only 2.86 GB, which by no means is small, but some reduction is better than naught. Another option Microsoft has provided is the ability to defer feature updates (upgrades) for a maximum of 365 days, and security updates for a maximum of 30 days (applicable only for Windows 10 Pro and above). This move is sensible, since quite a lot of users have reported failures in installing a feature update and this would give Microsoft the time to fix those critical bugs.</p>
<p>Overall Rating: 7/10. I would wish Microsoft pushes feature updates once a year, and a maintanence release after 2 months, as the current scenario would end up downloading around ~5.5 GB per year, just for OS upgrades.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>Many security features are present in every Windows 10 edition, including support for biometric authentication in Windows Hello, pervasive disk encryption, and built-in antimalware protection. Microsoft also provides the Windows Defender Security Center, which ties its many security features into a single dashboard.</p>
<p>Enterprise users also have a feature called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/Windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection">Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. </a>This feature is designed to detect threats that have made it past other defenses and provides corporate customers with tools to investigate breaches and offer suggested responses. There are other features like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard">Windows Defender Exploit Guard</a> and Windows Defender Application Control, again only for the Enterprise</p>
<p>Overall Rating : 9/10. Excellent security. I just wish that all the features are available for regular Windows 10 consumers.</p>
<h3>APPS</h3>
<p>Lack of apps &#8211; The weakest link in Windows 10. It is also one of the primary reasons why Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile shut down. Many of the popular desktop apps likeÂ Office, iTunes, Slack, and Spotify are now available in the store after UWP-ifying them through a bridge. Still they have done little to bring the Windows 10 app platform to life.</p>
<p>Sure, they now have some good AAA rating games on the Store, but they are still not enough in my view. Meanwhile, the apps that are included with a default installation of Windows 10 are greatly improved from the rough first-generation versions, but this is offset by the load of crapware, like Candy Crush that Microsoft bundles with every new Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>Overall Rating: 5.5/10</p>
<h3>FORCED ADVERTISING</h3>
<p>Now, this is one area that might seem forced upon, but there is an easy way to disable them. Still, an OS spreading such advertisements throughout the system is a bad way</p>

<img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/ubuntu-two-monitors-live-800px.jpg" alt="Higher resolution in Linux without adding new hardware?"><p>People with a Full HD Screen on a laptop will enjoy a large real estate, compared to those who do not have one. Those who don&#8217;t have a higher resolution display can now have one on their systems. The only caveat is you will need a Linux machine, and you must remember the aspect ratio of your display, 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 3:2 etc. However, a word of caution, I&#8217;m not responsible for any damage that happens to your product due to this article. Handle with care.</p>



<h2>ADD THE REQUIRED DISPLAY RATIO</h2>



<p>My current laptop has a resolution of 1366&#215;768, which translates to an aspect ratio of 16:9. I wanted to convert this screen into a Full HD experience. On a 16:9 display, a FHD resolution would have meant 1920x1080px resolution.</p>



<p>To add a display mode, you will need to use the command sudo cvt 1920 1080 60 , where 1920 is my width (in px), 1080 is my height , and 60 represents a 60Hz monitor refresh rate. This means that your monitor will update once in every 1/60th second.</p>



<p>You will now get an output something similar to the one below (If you don&#8217;t get something similar, it is because your display might not be supporting it):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz
Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync</pre>



<p>Now, you will need to copy everything that comes after Modeline, ie. &#8220;1920x1080_60.00&#8221; 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync .</p>



<p>Then run the command sudo xrandr &#8211;newmode &#8220;1920x1080_60.00&#8221; 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync</p>



<h2>CHECK WHETHER DISPLAY RATIO ADDED OR NOT</h2>



<p>To check whether your display ratio was added to the Linux system or not, you will need to use the command sudo xrandr -q . You will now get a list of display resolutions supported by your laptop. Your output should look like something below:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
eDP-1 connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm
   1366x768      60.00*+  40.00  
   1360x768      59.80    59.96  
   1280x720      60.00    59.99    59.86    59.74  
   1024x768      60.04    60.00  
   960x720       60.00  
   928x696       60.05  
   896x672       60.01  
   ...
   ... 
   360x202       59.51    59.13  
   320x180       59.84    59.32  
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
  1920x1080_60.00 (0x34e) 173.000MHz -HSync +VSync
        h: width  1920 start 2048 end 2248 total 2576 skew    0 clock  67.16KHz
        v: height 1080 start 1083 end 1088 total 1120           clock  59.96Hz
</pre>



<p><strong>Make note of the thing that appears in place of eDP-1 for you.</strong></p>



<h2>ADDING THE HIGHER RESOLUTION TO SETTINGS MENU</h2>



<p>After you have made a note of the name from the previous step, run the command sudo xrandr &#8211;addmode eDP-1 1920x1080_60.00 , where 1920&#215;1080 is your resolution, 60.00 represents the refresh rate, and eDP-1 is the display where you want to add the resolution. If there are no errors, there will not be any output.</p>



<h2>CHECK UBUNTU SETTINGS FOR THE NEW DISPLAY RATIO</h2>



<p>Now open Settings -> Display in your Ubuntu. In the display resolution you should now see the higher resolution, if everything went well, just like the one below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png" alt="Higher resolution in Linux without adding new hardware?" class="wp-image-422" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png 854w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-768x513.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-360x240.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px"></a></figure>



<h2>ANY SIDE EFFECTS?</h2>



<p>Well, there is one small side effect. The fonts appear slightly blurred because your display does not natively support the higher resolution. Rest assured that the text is completely readable, unlike what the scale menu and title bar option would have done.</p>



<p>Now until next time, let me enjoy my higher resolution and a large real estate.</p>

Android developers use the ADB interface to debug their apps, and polish it until they release it. In a world full of wires, when a developer wants to break free from wires and do debugging over wireless modem on his phone, he has only one option : do debugging over WiFi. This option works only if he is on a custom ROM based on CyanogenMod/LineageOS or has his original ROM rooted and using 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>Consider India. The release of Jio in the market has proven to be a boon to the users. So nowadays, Jio users do not want to connect their devices to WiFi. They&#8217;d rather connect these devices to the mobile hotspot.</p>
<p>In this scenario and other similar scenarios, things are slightly complex for Android Developers who want to use ADB over mobile hotspot. I searched through Stack Overflow and other relevant sites on how to do this. Out of the search results, one worked partially, others never worked. Here are the pages I am refering to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8861901/how-to-use-adb-over-mobile-ap-portable-wifi-hotspot">1</a> (partially worked) , <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604727/how-can-i-connect-to-android-with-adb-over-tcp">2</a> , <a href="https://gist.github.com/liminal/8801401">3</a></p>
<p>The first one partially worked, sometimes but not everytime. I was scratching my head until I came upon <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liam_w.networkadb">this app</a></p>
<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
<ol>
<li>The above mentioned app</li>
<li>ADB enabled on your phone</li>
<li><strong>A rooted phone</strong> (Important, without which there is no use of doing this)</li>
</ol>
<p>I ran this app, then enabled the toggle, finally saw something like this below:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app.png" alt="UPDATE: Enable ADB over a Mobile Hotspot in Android" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163" width="1080" height="1920" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app.png 1080w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app-169x300.png 169w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app-768x1365.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ADB-app-576x1024.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>It is showing an IPv6 address, which cannot be used to connect to ADB if the Android is not Nougat or above. That is where I was doomed. My Redmi Note 3 was running a custom ROM over Marshmallow (using a Nougat theme via CMTE, in case you were wondering of that icon).</p>
<p>But having a small experience in MAC address spoofing, I knew some Linux commands. The first thing I did was to connect my phone via USB to the laptop. Then I connected it to the ADB shell (<code>adb shell</code>). Then I ran <code>ifconfig</code>. There I can see a list of Modems in my phone. What I am concerned with is dummy0 (as shown in the screenshot) and wlan0.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig.png" alt="UPDATE: Enable ADB over a Mobile Hotspot in Android" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig.png 1366w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/ifconfig-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot there is an IPv6 address for dummy0 and IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for wlan0. So I ran <code>adb connect &lt;IPv6 addr&gt;</code> of both the modems. Luck failed. But then I ran <code>adb connect</code> for the <code>inet addr</code> of wlan0, which is coincidentally an IPv4 address. When I did that, booom&#8230;. <code>Connected to 192.168.43.1:5555</code></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected.png" alt="UPDATE: Enable ADB over a Mobile Hotspot in Android" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected.png 1366w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/connected-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p>
<h3>STEPS TO GET ADB OVER HOTSPOT WORKING</h3>
<p>One-time steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect phone to PC via USB</li>
<li>Connect your device to ADB</li>
<li>Run <code>adb shell ifconfig</code>. Note the <code>inet addr</code> value of <code>wlan0</code></li>
<li>Disconnect the phone</li>
</ol>
<p>Now remember the value of the <code>inet addr</code> . This is important. Now whenever you want to connect ADB over hotspot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the toggle in the app</li>
<li>Run <code>adb connect &lt;value of inet addr&gt;</code>. Then it must show connected to <code>&lt;inet addr&gt;:5555</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can do whatever you like.</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Please share this article, and let this get maximum reach. Android developers connected in the wires want to break free from this one day. So please, help developers make the world a better place.</p>
<h3>UPDATE 1</h3>
<p>Just to test my curiosity, I installed Android 7.1.2 on my device just to test this. Seems like connecting via an IPv6 address still didn&#8217;t work for me. Although connecting through this app and then following the steps above did the job for me.</p>
<h3>UPDATE 2</h3>
<p>It seems there are relatively easier steps to connect to adb when your PC is connected to the same mobile&#8217;s hotspot</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in your phone to the PC and connect</li>
<li>Run <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline ">adb tcpip 5555</span></li>
<li>Disconnect your phone</li>
<li>Now run <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline ">adb kill-server &amp;&amp; adb connect 192.168.43.1</span></li>
</ol>
<p>You can now have ADB over hotspot enabled for eternity, unless your battery dies down, or you disable the developer options.</p>

I had tried Raspbian, Windows 10 for IoT, and Retro Pi. None of them seemed to work for me, because despite having a wireless router, I could not have bridged internet facility from my phone to the router. This was pretty much critical for me. Enter Android Things.</p>
<h3>ANDROID THINGS</h3>
<p>I had indeed heard about Android Things before, but realized that it would work on my Raspberry Pi3 only towards the end of June 2018. Thus, I started off trying to install Android on my RPi.</p>
<h3>CREATING ANDROID THINGS CONSOLE ACCOUNT</h3>
<p>Before you can start using the setup utility provided, you need to create an account first on the <a href="https://partner.android.com/things/console/">Android Things Console</a>. After creating an account, you need to register a device here. In this particular case, it is going to be a Raspberry Pi 3, and you have to agree the terms for using it as a non-commercial device.</p>
<p>Once you are done with that, you can download the setup tools provided in the Android Things console. You can then use the instructions on <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi">this page</a> to setup Android Things on your Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also setup Wi-Fi on the Raspberry Pi as well. Just follow the setup instructions after you have flashed the Android Things Image on the SD Card, within the same terminal screen.</p>
<h3>ACCESSING YOUR NEW IoT DEVICE WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL DISPLAY</h3>
<p>Congratulations on setting up your new IoT device. Now how would you check whether it is working or not. Obviously if the Ethernet lights are glowing, then your installation is working fine. So far great, but now how do you access the display of the Raspberry Pi Android Things given that you don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<p>To access your RPi3 display on your laptop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect Your RPi3 and your laptop on the same Wi-Fi network</li>
<li>Connect your RPi3 to the router via Ethernet port of the same Wi-Fi router.</li>
<li>Download Chrome Browser, and the Vysor extension</li>
<li>You will now need the IP address of the Raspberry Pi connected to your router. You should be able to get that by navigating to your router interface in the browser</li>
<li>Then open up a terminal, then enter <span class="theme:obsidian lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">adb connect ENTER_THE_IP_ADDRESS_HERE</span> . Your PC should now be connected to your RPi3 running Android Studio</li>
<li>Open Chrome, Then Chrome Apps, finally launch Vysor from there. In the list of connected devices you should be seeing your Raspberry Pi 3 over there. Select View next to it</li>
<li>You can now see your Android Things screen on your laptop ð</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/06/Screenshot-from-2018-06-20-22-26-58.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/06/Screenshot-from-2018-06-20-22-26-58.png" alt="How to setup any Android Things device without an external monitor" class="size-full wp-image-401 aligncenter" width="720" height="654" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/06/Screenshot-from-2018-06-20-22-26-58.png 720w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/06/Screenshot-from-2018-06-20-22-26-58-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<h3>ANY MORE STEPS NEEDED</h3>
<p>Once you setup your Android Things on Raspberry Pi 3, you will notice that the time is wrong, and the timezone is also wrong. You will also notice a gear icon next to the timezone, but that wouldn&#8217;t do anything. You will have to manually change your timezone using ADB</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal, execute <span class="theme:obsidian lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline ">adb shell</span></li>
<li>Note which timezone would you want to apply. I want to set it to the Indian Standard Time, so I would be running the command <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline ">setprop persist.sys.timezone Asia/Kolkata</span></li>
<li>Then exit the adb shell</li>
<li>Then execute <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">adb shell date</span> , and now you should be able to see the updated timezone. But sadly this will not reflect on the Android Things just yet.</li>
<li>You need to restart the device in order to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Now that I have set up Android Things on my Raspberry Pi 3, I should now head over to trying some sample projects and running it there. If possible, me and my team, TheAndroidPeople at FOSS@Amrita will come up with something innovative Android Things Project.</p>

After installing, I found that Reverse Scrolling/Natural Scrolling option was missing from Settings in Unity, while it was available in GNOME settings. This was pretty much a deal breaker for me, so I had to find a way to enable reverse scrolling via some GUI or even a CLI.</p>
<h3>ENTER libinput</h3>
<p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/index.html">libinput</a> is a library which is used to handle input devices in Ubuntu&#8217;s Display Server X.org. With further investigation, I found out that Unity, GNOME and XFCE and a host of Desktop environments support it. My hopes were high after discovering this. To enable Reverse Scrolling via libinput, follow the steps below.</p>
<h3>FIND WHICH IS YOUR TOUCHPAD</h3>
<p>You need to find which one among the input devices is your touchpad since libinput is used to handle input devices. This can be easily known by executing the command <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">xinput &#8211;list<br>
</span></p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">â¡ Virtual core pointer                    	id=2	[master pointer  (3)]
â   â³ Virtual core XTEST pointer              	id=4	[slave  pointer  (2)]
â   â³ Elan Touchpad                           	id=12	[slave  pointer  (2)]
â£ Virtual core keyboard                   	id=3	[master keyboard (2)]
    â³ Virtual core XTEST keyboard             	id=5	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Power Button                            	id=6	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Asus Wireless Radio Control             	id=7	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Video Bus                               	id=8	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Video Bus                               	id=9	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Sleep Button                            	id=10	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ USB Camera: USB Camera                  	id=11	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ Asus WMI hotkeys                        	id=13	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    â³ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard            	id=14	[slave  keyboard (3)]
</pre>
<p>Now obviously my touchpad cannot be a keyboard, so it has to be one among the Virtual Core Pointer. Elan Touchpad definitely sounded familiar to me, as I had installed its driver in Windows 10.</p>
<h3>CHECK IF REVERSE SCROLLING CAN BE ENABLED OR NOT</h3>
<p>The next step is to check whether your touchpad supports Reverse Scrolling or not. While I had an option to enable Reverse Scrolling from Settings when in Unity in Ubuntu 16.04, the option was gone in 18.04, but it was still available in GNOME. So I thought it should be available in libinput as well. To check if I can enable Reverse Scrolling in Unity in Ubuntu 18.04, I tried the command</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">xinput --list-props "Elan Touchpad"</pre>
<p>(PS. Make sure that Elan Touchpad is inside the quotation marks if the name of your touchpad has spaces in between, and I shouldn&#8217;t be telling you to substitute Elan Touchpad with the name of your touchpad)</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">Device 'Elan Touchpad':
	Device Enabled (145):	1
	Coordinate Transformation Matrix (147):	1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000

</pre>
<p>You should look for an option that has Reverse Scrolling, or Natural Scrolling in it. Luckily I did have an option called <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled (288): 0</span>. So I was sure that I can enable it in Ubuntu 18.04. Now it was only a matter of another command, after which I can use Reverse Scrolling without hassles.</p>
<p>PS. If you do not see an option like Reverse Scrolling anywhere inside that output, I&#8217;m afraid my friend, I cannot help you.</p>
<h3>ENABLE NATURAL SCROLLING</h3>
<p>One Command&nbsp; <code class=" language-bash">xinput --set-prop "Elan Touchpad" <span class="token string">"libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled"</span> 1</code></p>
<p>This was enough to enable Reverse Scrolling. Plus it happened in an instant, I never had to log out or restart at all.</p>
<p>PS. If the command with the list-props flag output shows something like &#8216;Synaptics&#8217; at the beginning of each prop instead of &#8216;libinput&#8217;, please check the update below.</p>
<h3>AFTER EXPERIENCES</h3>
<p>Using libinput I could bring back one feature I loved the most. But the behavior I get with the touchpad in Unity in Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 is completely different. There are three pain points with the new experience in Ubuntu 18.04:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could select text by tapping on the touchpad, and not clicking it.</li>
<li>You could keep selecting the text and scroll up or down with the touchpad</li>
<li>I could tap using two fingers to emulate right click</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly I can&#8217;t do either of these things with Ubuntu 18.04. While I can still do point no. 1 and 3 using GNOME, I can&#8217;t do point 2 with that either. So I still have hopes of getting points 1 and 3 back on track with libinput again, but I&#8217;ll pray that one day I&#8217;m able to get back point 2 as well.</p>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>With libinput, I ran the following command <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">xinput &#8211;set-prop &#8220;Elan Touchpad&#8221; &#8220;libinput Tapping Enabled&#8221; 1</span>, and I was able to get point 1 and 3 working fine. Point 2 was still not working.</p>
<p>I asked my friends who had a similar laptop model, to run the command and then they got synaptics props instead of libinput. I realized that Ubuntu 18.04 did not come with synaptics, rather it came with libinput. Now I installed synaptics using&nbsp;<span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline ">sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics</span>&nbsp; after which I restarted my laptop.</p>
<p>I was able to get the same Mouse experiences present in Ubuntu 16.04 to Unity in Ubuntu 18.04 without hassles. Moreover, the fine details of touchpad settings like Reverse Scrolling are now back in Touchpad settings in Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

This depressed me. Luckily searching in my hard disk, I found an old backup, but it didn&#8217;t have newer code. So I had realized then that I needed to have backups of my app at regular intervals of time. But doing so would have taken up a lot of system space, and a lot of time to back it up too. I needed another solution</p>
<p>I was also fortunate to have been a member of our FOSS Club at that time (I still am), wherein I had learnt how to use Git. <span>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.</span><span> </span>In Noob terms, Git is used when you write a software, you periodically write down (commit, in terms of Git language) what all changes you did when you were writing the code, and push them to a repository (recommended to do periodically)</p>
<p>One thing while seeing newbies push their Android apps source code to GitHub, I realized that they only push the necessary Java files they used to get the app running. There is a disadvantage to this method, if someone else wants to run your app, he cannot do it only on the basis of the Java files, he will need the whole working project &#8211; starting from the Java files, all the way upto the Layout resource XMLs, Gradle files and the resources inside your project. So I will be telling how to push your existing Android projects to git properly.</p>
<p>PS. This is only for beginners. For intermediate and advanced guys, there are lots of things like CI and Code coverage which I will not be discussing here.</p>
<h3>FIRST THINGS FIRST</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn how Git functions from a tutorial (I will prefer <a href="http://try.github.io">this</a> one)</li>
<li>Install git on your laptop (Google it guys, it is your best friend)</li>
<li>Create a repository on GitHub or whatever site that supports hosting git repositories</li>
<li>Name it according to the project (in our case, the app) that you are developing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INITIALIZE GIT IN YOUR LOCAL DIRECTORY</h3>
<p>Now that you have created a git repository, navigate to the root directory of your project folder. Now there will be a lot of folders inside your project. Which one is the root folder?<a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-4-1.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-4-1.png" alt="Add git to existing Android projects" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-327" width="842" height="472" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-4-1.png 842w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-4-1-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-4-1-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now there will be a lot of build.gradle files in your project (depending on the number of modules you have, remember app shown here is only one such module, you may have many such more modules)</p>
<p>Your project root folder will be the one which contains a build.gradle, along with gradle.properties, settings.gradle and the gradle executable, depending upon which OS you are using. If you see all these files inside a folder, good that is your project root.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have installed Git on your system by now. If you are on Windows, Right click on your project root folder, and you will see an option to open &#8220;Git Bash Here&#8221;. Select that. If you are on Linux/Mac, right click on project root folder, select open in terminal.</p>
<p>Now given that you have not initialized git here before, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given you are in the terminal/CMD, type
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">git init</pre>
<p>This will initialize a git repository on your local machine</p></li>
<li>Get your project to build fine without errors before proceeding to the next step (It would have a bad impression to not getting your first commit build properly)</li>
<li>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">git add .</pre>
<p>Executing this command will properly add all the files in your project to your local git repository</p></li>
<li>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">git commit -m "First Commit"</pre>
<p>That is the general way to do a first commit, but there are no issues if you want a different Commit message.</p></li>
<li>Copy the URL of the repo you created on GitHub. Then do these two steps
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push origin master</pre>
<p>Congratulations, now you have your first backup of your app stored safely in the cloud (unless there is a physical calamity that causes harm to servers, but they will have backup servers everywhere)</p></li>
<li>After you push your code into GitHub, it should probably look like this<a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5.png" alt="Add git to existing Android projects" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-328" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5.png 1366w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2018/03/Screenshot-5-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>HOW TO PROCEED FROM HERE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to note of the small changes that you do inside your app. Whenever you change a Java file make sure you note it in your mind what you have done. Whenever you have changed an XML layout, note that in your mind too.</li>
<li><strong>Do not change too many files at once</strong> unless absolutely necessary</li>
<li>Make sure the changes you do are able to successfully build your app</li>
<li>Make sure the changes you do are able to run successfully on your Android device/emulator</li>
<li>After you make sure that the changes you do have worked, commit them like you did above.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Following such general guidelines will help you when you work with not only Android projects, but with other projects as well.</p>
<p>Hope that this post provided a good insight to introduction to working with Git on Android.</p>

It could prove to be a difficult task if you are working with repositories from a Command Line Interface. In this blog post, I will explain how to properly set-up 2 Factor Authentication to work with GitHub.</p>
<p>PS. I will be juggling between 2FA, 2-FA and 2 Factor Authentication throughout the post, rest assured that all mean the same</p>
<h3>ENABLE 2-FA IN GITHUB</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sign-in to GitHub</li>
<li>Click on your profile picture at the top right corner of the navigation bar, and select Settings</li>
<li>Select Security tab from the left selection panel, and then click set up Two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Select Set up using an app. Then you will see some recovery codes on your screen. If you uninstall the authenticator app from your phone, you will need access to the recovery codes to access your account again. Make sure you save it in a safe place.</li>
<li>You will now configure 2 Factor Authentication from your phone</li>
</ol>
<h3>DOWNLOAD AN AUTHENTICATOR APP</h3>
<p>There are a lot of options available for a 2FA app. The notable ones are Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Lastpass Authenticator, Authy and Yubico Authenticator. If you want to backup 2FA codes and use it across devices, I would personally suggest you to use Authy. If not, Google Authenticator is a really good bet on Android as it is easy to use. In this tutorial I use Authy to do my job.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en">Authy</a> from the Google Play Store</li>
<li>Login with your Authy account to restore your 2FA Codes from the backup in the cloud. If you don&#8217;t have one, it will prompt you to create one.</li>
<li>Click on add new account from the three dots menu, then select Scan QR Code. Take a picture of the QR Code</li>
<li>The app will now save your GitHub account. Then enter the security code from your app into the browser and click Enable.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now configured your GitHub account with 2FA Succesfully. Now you will need to configure your local machine&#8217;s Git CLI or GUI with 2FA. If you are using a GUI like Gitkraken to manage your repositories, just sign-in to your GitHub account, and that&#8217;s it. Follow the next steps to configure your GitHub account with 2FA for the terminal</p>
<h3>ENABLE GIT CREDENTIAL CACHING</h3>
<p>Now that you have configured your GitHub account with 2FA, you will need to enter your access token (more on this later) instead of your password everytime. The problem with this is there is no way to remember an access token once you create one. So, after you create an access token you will need to store it in your local machine, which is why we will use git credential caching</p>
<p>Since we are on a Linux terminal, we can use either of the following commands:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">git config --global credential.helper store</pre>
<h3>CREATE PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN</h3>
<p>Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. In other words, you can use it instead of your regular password for doing changes to your repo. This would be very useful as regular passwords don&#8217;t work with 2FA.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Generate a GitHub API key</a> under âPersonal Access Tokensâ in the Settings page. Youâll use this for the Git command line. Leave the scopesÂ unchanged.</p>
<h3>PUSH THE REPO</h3>
<p>After configuring the personal access token, you need to configure the terminal with it for the first time. Push a repo, it will ask for your username and password, instead of password add the personal access token there. Once you do it, you are done configuring 2FA with the Git repos on your system.</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>Another very important feature that drew our attention is compatibility. The videos rendered through this software are fully compatible with desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. So, no matter where your viewer is watching it, he/she will get the best viewing experience &#8211; be it on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter or as a downloaded video.</p>
<p>This indeed is a very useful feature, especially if you want to send out your videos to a larger audience. This way you can ensure that your message will reach your viewers no matter what device they are using.</p>
<h3>Editing Interface</h3>
<p>Renderforest is probably the easiest video maker software out there. The editing interface is a breeze to use. You can change almost every aspect of your chosen template to customize it. Starting from pictures and text till color scheme, you can customize them all according to your preference without any tech help.</p>
<p>The editing tools let you add music or voice-overs to make your video look more presentable. I found the voice-over feature quite crucial for explainer video production. I wish we could add more images or our text to it.</p>
<h3>Re-Editing Facility</h3>
<p>The software lets you re-edit already rendered videos. This way even if you make some mistakes on the first go, you can later go back and rectify those. This feature is hugely helpful for those who are making a video for the very first time.</p>
<p>The feature is also quite handy if you want to remodel an already made video presentation and use it for a different purpose. The software lets you re-edit your videos as many times as you want.</p>
<h3>3D Videos</h3>
<p>Renderforest offers 3D video making services too. There are some excellent 3D templates that you can use for the purpose. To my delight, I found the editing tools to be pretty similar to that of 2D templates. With this feature, you can create highly professional 3D videos to convey your ideas or showcase your projects.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>I registered this software to access the user-friendliness of the software. The registration process is pretty simple. You can register with only basic information such as your name and e-mail address. You can also do social logins as well.</p>
<p>There is no need to provide any card details to register to the website. Once you register, you can immediately start creating your video in an easy 3 step process.</p>
<p>Step 1: The first move is to select a template for your video. Browse through the array of excellent templates and choose one according to your requirement. Once chosen select the same, and youâll reach the editing interface. Since I want a promo video for my mobile app, I select the Promotional Category, in which I select Mobile App Promotion.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18.png" alt="Best tool for creating a mobile app promo: Renderforest" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18.png 1366w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/12/Screenshot-18-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p>
<p>You can first have a look at a preview of what each template can offer. Then go ahead and select that template</p>
<p>Step 2: Now upload your photographs that you want to include in your video. You can use the editing tools here and add texts, change colors, add voice-over, etc. The editing tools are pretty simple to use and being completely novice in video making I found it pretty smooth.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you are satisfied with the sequence of the pictures, music, and texts, just render your video. With the one click, youâll get your professionally designed high-quality video that you can use for business presentations, e-mail marketing or personal purpose.</p>
<h3>Plans &amp; Pricing</h3>
<p>There are three types of pricing plans available for Renderforest. For complete details of pricing navigate <a href="https://www.renderforest.com/signup?afil_link=0a4c0a81df76763db7a71de111871495" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here :</a>Â Subscription, Pay per export and Handcrafted Video Production for businesses. In n the first two pricing categories, the basic plan is entirely free of cost. While this basic plan is quite enough for personal usages and small businesses, videos bear the Renderforest watermark on all free packages. If the watermark does not bother you much, then you can use the free package as long as you want. Although for advanced services and features, going for a higher package is no doubt recommended.</p>
<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<p>After reviewing all the features and aspects of the software, we firmly recommend Renderforest for professional and personal use. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superbly easy to use.</li>
<li>A wide range of templates to choose from for various purposes.</li>
<li>Hassle free registration.</li>
<li>Unlimited free usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would&#8217;ve also wished for a slightly more flexible payment options, other than that it is really awesome. So, with all these impressive features on offer Renderforest is truly the best free video making software available today. So, try the software now and do let me know your experience with it.</p>

I have had issues with Android Databases in the past. Many a time I could not get it working due to problems. As I slowly started searching through docs on the web, I could gain knowledge on SQLite. In today&#8217;s blog post, I will be decribing how to do basic DB Related Operations on Android using SQLite</p>
<p></p>
<h3>QUERY</h3>
<p>Suppose you wanted to write a query like</p>
<pre class="attributes" lang="sql">
SELECT * FROM Question , Category WHERE enabled=1 AND Category.CAT = Question.CAT
</pre>
<p>Of course, you could write this whole expression inside a String and then use the <code>db.execSQL()</code> method. You would have to waste the space required for a String and the Cursor. Using the <code>query()</code> method, you will need to waste the space only for the Cursor. Here is the syntax for the <code>query()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="attributes" lang="java">
public Cursor query (String table, String[] columns, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String groupBy, String having, String orderBy, String limit)
</pre>
<p>Here are what each of them mean:<br>
&#8211; <code>table</code> : The table name to compile the query against<br>
&#8211; <code>columns</code> : A list of columns that have to be returned in the query. Passing null returns all columns (Synchronous to <code>SELECT * FROM ...</code>), which is discouraged<br>
&#8211; <code>selection</code> : This declares which rows to return. This would be synchronous to the <code>SQL WHERE</code> command (eg. <code>SELECT * FROM Category WHERE enabled=1</code>)<br>
&#8211; <code>selectionArgs</code> : You may include ?s in selection, which will be replaced by the values from selectionArgs, in order that they appear in the selection. The values which are returned will be bound as Strings.<br>
&#8211; <code>groupBy</code> : Filter declaring how the rows must be grouped, synchronous to <code>SQL GROUP BY</code> command. Passing null would result in no grouping of the output<br>
&#8211; <code>having</code> : A filter declare which row groups to include in the cursor, if row grouping is being used, formatted as an <code>SQL HAVING</code> clause. Passing null will cause all row groups to be included, and is required when row grouping is not being used.<br>
&#8211; <code>orderBy</code> : This states how to order the rows, synchronous to <code>SQL ORDER BY</code> command. Passing null, will return the output as is without any ordering<br>
&#8211; <code>limit</code> : Limits the number of rows returned</p>
<p>This function returns a <code>Cursor</code> object which is placed before the first row.</p>
<p>(To be continued..)</p>

Welcome to Simple Weather v4. This is a really big release. I&#8217;ve heard from the Open Source Community (FDroid , Emails , GitHub issues) and the Play Store Reviews. They all wanted me to add a few new features to the already wonderful app. So without wasting time, I&#8217;ll tour you through the new features.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>NEW FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li>New weather Screen with minor tweaks</li>
<li>Weather Widget and Hourly Notifications</li>
<li>New Weather Graphs and Weather Maps</li>
<li>View Weather Data in Fahrenheit too</li>
<li>Use your own custom Open Weather Map key</li>
<li>Refreshed About Screen</li>
<li>New Icon</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>DOWNLOAD THE APP</h3>
<p>With this release, you now have two sources to download the app from &#8211; the Google Play Store and the F Droid Store. While this update is currently live on the Play Store, it will take some time to arrive on FDroid Store (PS. Do not download v3 from the FDroid store, it was meant for Beta testing) (because FDroid isn&#8217;t that great when it comes to scanning through releases, v4 will soon be available there in a few days).</p>
<p><a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.a5corp.weather">F-Droid</a><br>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a5corp.weather"><img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png" style="width: 210px; height: 80px;" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4"></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>NEW ICON</h3>
<p>Ah, sadly yes, this is one of the changes too. I know I had just changed the icon in v2, but I think this was really necessary to convey what my app is trying to deliver. Sadly a Sun over a black background would mean complete darkness. So this was necessary. It is also aligned to the main color of my app. Enjoy the new icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>SLIGHTLY TWEAKED WEATHER SCREEN, NEW WEATHER OPTIONS</h3>
<p>Once you upgrade to this new version, you will now see a slightly tweaked main screen. All the information you need, is now in one place. Right here,</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-175" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/2-1-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p>As you can also see from the picture above, the Search Red Floating Button has now been moved to the toolbar. This was necessary because in lot of the Reviews I had seen that the FAB (floating Button) usually would hide the details of the last weather item. I could not find a replacement in time, thus I had to move the search button to the main toolbar. And also you can see a Drawer toggle in the toolbar, Right? Yay, open that up and you see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-176" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/3-1-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p>This upgrade adds a big request you have all been asking for, Fahrenheit temperatures. Hit the toggle, and the weather screen (if visible) will show you the new Fahrenheit values. I know this could have been better (rather than always refreshing when hitting that toggle), but I will work on it when I get time .</p>
<p>You can also see 2 new options under the Home tab &#8211; Weather Graphs and Weather Maps. These are 2 new ways to display the weather information:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/4-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177" src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/4-1.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840"></a></p>
<div id="slider_183_slide02" class="sa_hover_container" style="padding:5% 5%; margin:0px 0%; "><p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/5-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/5-1.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840"></a></p>

<p>What&#8217;s more exciting is that you can launch this from your home screen right away. So you need not visit the app ,open the drawer and select the option. Rather, if you are running Android 7.1.1+, you could do this from your launcher as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-179" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/6-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p>On the Weather Graphs screen, if you hit that empty circle on top, it will show the values on the graph. Moreover, you can change between the three states (Rain, Wind, Temperature) in the Weather Maps screen too.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WEATHER NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>You can also opt to see weather notifications on an hourly basis as well. Just hit the &#8220;Show Hourly Notifications&#8221; toggle, and you will get essential weather updates every hour, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-180" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WEATHER WIDGETS</h3>
<p>Here is another big feature request being released today &#8211; Weather Widgets. These might be slightly buggy on your phone restart (I will work on this in the near future too), otherwise these should just run fine. There are 2 sizes of this widget &#8211; Large and Small, whose size you can increase if your launcher supports that option.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/8.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/8-768x1382.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" style="width: 1024px; height: 569px;"></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>CUSTOM OPENWEATHERMAP KEY</h3>
<p>As you can see in the Drawer pic, you can now choose to load the Weather Data with your own Custom OWM Key (I would encourage, not recommend all to perform this daring step). Doing so can help slow down the amount of server crashes happening due to my Key.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>A NEW ABOUT SCREEN</h3>
<p>Also, here is a slightly tweaked About Screen</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9.png"><img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9.png" alt="Announcing Simple Weather v4" width="2134" height="3840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182" srcset="https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9.png 2134w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9-167x300.png 167w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9-768x1382.png 768w, https://blog.sparker0i.me/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/9-569x1024.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px"></a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>WHY IS THE APP v4 AND NOT v3</h4>
<p>Potentially, this question would have arose on seeing the title itself, &#8220;Where did v3 go?&#8221;. It never went anywhere, I had decided to do Beta testing with v3. Another reason why I didn&#8217;t name the Play Store release as v3 was because the number 3 is unlucky for me. In my early school days, I was always ranked #3 , which never excited me. I started to feel #3 was plain and boring right from then (and unlucky too).</p>
